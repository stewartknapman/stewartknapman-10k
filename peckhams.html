Unlike most ciders currently on the New Zealand market their approach is a lot more traditional, using heritage apples to create a mature range of dry&nbsp;ciders.</p><p>Alex and Caroline approached me to help them create a flexible label that could be used for small, or limited runs of special ciders. It needed to have a consistent look and feel that fitted the Peckham's brand, but also stand alone from the rest of the core range. Most importantly the details on the label needed to be able to change with each new&nbsp;release.</p><p>What we came up with was more of a framework. The label was first printed with only the information that would never change, this included the branding and the artwork created by Alex's father. Then using a template the details of each run is overprinted in-house, using a thermal printer similar to those used in some airports to print boarding&nbsp;passes.</p></div></main><footer><nav><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/stewartknapman" title="Stewart Knapman on Twitter"><i id="t"></i><span class="h">Twitter</span></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/stewartknapman" title="Stewart Knapman on Github"><i id="g"></i><span class="h">Github</span></a></li><li><a href="https://dribbble.com/stewartknapman" title="Stewart Knapman on Dribbble"><i id="d"></i><span class="h">Dribbble</span></a></li></ul></nav><a href="/colophon.html">About this site</a></footer></body></html>
